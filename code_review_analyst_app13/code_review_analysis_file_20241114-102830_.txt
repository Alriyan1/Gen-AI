def is_prime(num):
    """Efficiently checks if a number is prime."""  # Docstring added for clarity

    if num <= 1:  # Combined conditions (lines 3 and 5)

    if num <= 3:  # Handle 2 and 3 separately for efficiency
        return True 
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:  # Quick check for divisibility by 2 or 3
        return False

    # Optimized loop: Only check up to the square root of num, and increment by 6 (6k ± 1 optimization)
    for i in range(5, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1, 6):  
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False

    return True  # No divisors found, so it's prime

# Key Improvements:
# - Function is_prime(): Encapsulates the prime-checking logic for reusability.
# - Docstring: Added for better understanding of the function's purpose.
# - Efficiency: 
#     - Handles base cases (0, 1, 2, 3) directly.
#     - Optimizes the loop by checking only up to the square root of num.
#     - Uses the 6k ± 1 optimization for further efficiency.
# - Clearer Logic: Uses return statements within the function to avoid the flag variable, making the code more readable.
# - Combined Conditions: Simplified the initial checks for num <= 1.
```


Specific comments related to the original code lines:

- **Line 2:** Using a flag variable can often make logic less clear. It's better to use `return` statements within a function to directly indicate the result.
- **Lines 3-4:** These can be combined with the `elif num > 1` condition.
- **Line 6:** The loop's upper bound can be optimized to `int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1`. We only need to check divisors up to the square root. Further optimization is using 6k ± 1.
- **Lines 7-9:** The `flag` and `break` can be replaced with a direct `return False` within the function.
- **Lines 11-14:** The output can be simplified by using the function's return value.


By implementing these changes, the code becomes more efficient, readable, and reusable.  The 6k ± 1 optimization significantly reduces the number of iterations required for larger numbers, making the prime check considerably faster.  Encapsulating the logic in a function promotes code organization and allows you to reuse the `is_prime` check elsewhere in your program if needed.
